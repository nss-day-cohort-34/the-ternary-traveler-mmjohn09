The crowds are massive during the day, so try to go either really early (before 8:30am) or at night then you can really take in the beauty of the fountain",

The great part for museum lovers is that 99% of everyone in the museum just goes to the Mona Lisa and leaves (the line for the Mona Lisa moves surprisingly quickly for those interested in seeing it), so you'll have plenty of space to wander around the other exhibits. Beautiful architecture and an enormous building.",
